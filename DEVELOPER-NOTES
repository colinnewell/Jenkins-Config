These are notes on things done to build this module.

They probably aren't relevant to most people, I just didn't want
to lose the information on how I figured out the initial parts
of the system.

XSD created with trang (available as a package on Ubuntu)

XML::Compile hash structure generated using XML::Compile itself 
with a dinky little program like this,

#!/usr/bin/env perl

use strict;
use XML::Compile::Schema;
my $schema = XML::Compile::Schema->new('config.xsd');
print $schema->template('PERL' => 'project');
